<h2>General Business Terms</h2>

<h3>Scope</h3>

The General Terms and Conditions (GTC) apply to all contracts concluded between UPGRADE – 8 e.U (hereinafter: Seller) and the consumer (hereinafter: Customer) via the website www.upgrade-8.at.

<h3>Conclusion of Contract</h3>

The presentation of products on the website does not constitute a legally binding offer from the seller, but rather an invitation to submit an offer by the buyer.
The buyer can submit the offer using the online order form integrated into the website. By placing the desired goods in the virtual shopping cart and completing the electronic ordering process, the buyer makes a legally binding offer to conclude a contract by clicking the button that concludes the ordering process.
The seller can accept the buyer's offer within 2 working days by sending the order confirmation via email. The order confirmation will be sent to the buyer via email.
If the seller does not accept the buyer's offer within the above-mentioned period, this constitutes a rejection of the offer, as a result of which the buyer is no longer bound to the declaration of intent.

<h3>Prices and Shipping Costs</h3>

The prices of the goods are stated on the Seller's website. The prices include the applicable statutory value added tax.

<h3>Payment Terms</h3>

Payment is made in advance. The customer can pay by bank transfer.

<h3>Shipping Terms</h3>

Unless otherwise stated in the offer, the delivery time is 5-7 working days.
Delivery is made to the delivery address specified by the customer.

<h3>Retention of Title</h3>

The delivered goods remain the property of the seller until the full purchase price has been paid.
The customer will be informed about the shipping costs on the seller's website.

<h3>Right of Withdrawal</h3>

Consumers are legally regulated by the right of withdrawal. Further information on the right of withdrawal can be found in the seller's withdrawal statement.

<h3>Warranty</h3>

The customer's warranty rights are based on statutory provisions.

<h3>Liability</h3>

The seller is fully liable for intent and gross negligence. The seller is only liable for slight negligence if essential contractual obligations (primary obligations) are violated, so liability is limited to foreseeable, typical damage.
Liability for damages resulting from the breach of essential contractual obligations is limited to the foreseeable damages typical for the contract.
Liability for damages resulting from injury to life, body, or health remains unaffected.
If the seller's liability is excluded or limited, this also applies to the personal liability of the seller's employees, representatives, and vicarious agents.

<h3>Data Protection</h3>

We collect, process, and use customer data in compliance with the applicable data protection regulations. Further information on data protection can be found in the seller's data protection statement.

<h3>Others</h3>

Austrian law shall apply, excluding the UN Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods. The place of jurisdiction for all disputes arising from the contractual relationship is the seller's registered office. If individual provisions of these General Terms and Conditions become invalid or ineffective, this shall not affect the validity of the remaining provisions. Supplementary provisions apply to the sale of dietary supplements. Dietary supplements do not replace a balanced diet and a healthy lifestyle. Before taking dietary supplements, consult your doctor or pharmacist, especially if you are pregnant or breastfeeding, or if you have any health problems.
