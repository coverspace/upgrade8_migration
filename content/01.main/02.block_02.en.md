  For nearly 10 years, I struggled with many symptoms that doctors couldn't treat much:

  I kept asking why they weren't helping ??? What's happening to me ???
  I began to read about which ancient herbs could help me, and that's how the 8 elements, my aid = UPGRADE–8 L/G was born. The next blood test came after about 6 months.
  Previously, my cholesterol was over 300, and it was already high above 200. After 6 months, the results puzzled my doctor. He said, I don't know what you're doing, or what you're taking, but keep doing it!

  About 4-5 months later, I noticed I had more energy, later my stomach hurt less, and my irritable bowel syndrome disappeared.
  The more abdominal fat you carry, the greater your risk of these diseases. Fatty liver practically makes attempts to lose weight impossible. Fatty liver, so to speak, clogs the transport routes to remove abdominal fat from the body.
  What's shocking is that 30-35% of adults suffer from fatty liver disease, and hardly anyone knows about it!

  So the solution is obvious = we need to detoxify, we need to rid our liver, gallbladder of fat!!!

  - item: "It improves digestion and helps the body break down and absorb nutrients."
  - item: "No change or side effects due to natural ingredients."
